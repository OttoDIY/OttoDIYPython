  The methods are:
    Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to pins.
    attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
    attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
    default min is 544, max is 2400  
 
    write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
    writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds 
    read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
    readMicroseconds()   - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
    attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
    detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.

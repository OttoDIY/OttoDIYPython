# OttoDIYPython

This is a port of the OttoDIY Robot API ([Otto9.h](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYLib/blob/master/Otto9.h)) to a [micropython based esp platform](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html)

This project just begun ... it's not ready for use yet ... [please look at 
the issues](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYPython/issues) to see if you can help make this a reality ...

The Motion Code has been ported ... and a test file has been created ... to test this out

1) Install Micropython onto your microcontroller (I used a esp8266 nodemcu board)
2) Upload these files on to the board ... Use uPyCraft or ampy
3) run the Otto_allmoves_V9.py file from the REPL with the follwoing command

`>>>import Otto_allmoves_V9`
